# Overview

This repository contains patches to add transparent huge pages to glibc,
as well as tooling to test these changes, and use the available patches although
they are not integrated into glibc yet.

# Examples

### Use container to statically link tool against environment THP libc.a file

 CONTAINER=$(docker build -q docker)
 cd <the directory of your tool>
 docker run -v "$PWD":"$PWD" -w "$PWD" "$CONTAINER" <static-linking-build-command>
 GLIBC_THP_ALWAYS=1 <your-statically-linked-tool> $PARAMETER
 
To check whether huge pages are used, you can run the following in a separate
terminal:
 
 watch -n 1 "cat /proc/meminfo | grep -i huge"
